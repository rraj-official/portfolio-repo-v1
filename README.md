### Introduction
Hi, I am Rohit. This is my first-ever React WebApp and my first project. I built it to showcase my skills in ReactJS, Tailwind CSS and web-design.

### Features
+ **Auto-scroll**: Scrolls down to the element with the given ID with a smooth transition. Built using react-scroll component.
+ **Custom Theme Kit**: Uses a theme prop that is passed either directly or through several functions down the pipeline of components to theme the entire app from a single point. Built entirely from scratch utilising ReactJS's one-way child-parent component relationship.
+ **Hover buttons**: Styled using Tailwind CSS. Entire website boasts the utility-first classes of tailwind CSS for quick development.
+ **Sticky NavBar**: Also a tailwind CSS styled react component that features a change theme button built using a custom theme kit.
+ **Sticky Snapshot**: Sticky snapshot built using tailwind that sticks to the side and shows realtime snapshots of my github page.
